# A fair warning
Steam and Rift accounts are NOT intended to be in safety mode under any circumstance. 

This mod is unlikely to cause any issues, but only run it at your own risk. If you break your account then it's not my responsibility.


Also I have no idea why this repository has the source code in the same directory as the .sln is. Don't ask me, I don't remember lmao
